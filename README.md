# Paint-Calculator
calculates the amount of paint required finished in 38 minutes.

Just setup JDK Build and run and it should work- I did use Intellij IDEA Community Edition.

I did have an extra part of code which included a switch statement that allowed the user to choose weather or not to go again, without stopping the program
and just keep running it instead, however i dint put it in becuase i dint know if i was allowed to, so below are the images of the code along with it being played out.
